This repository is an attempt to make an R package with some metrics for confusion matrix analyses. Those functions were based on Louzada (et.al, 2016) article called "Classification methods applied to credit scoring: Systematic review and overall comparison".

If you want to install this package, pleave be sure that you have `roxygen2` and `devtools` packages in your machine.Any doubts, please check this post from Hilary Parker: https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/
